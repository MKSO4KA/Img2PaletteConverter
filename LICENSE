Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some people think that our license is too long and too hard to understand. But it is the best way to ensure that everyone is free to share and change the software.

                             TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. The "License" means this document. 

   "Licensor" means the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that grants you the License. 

   "You" means an individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by this License. 

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work. 

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body. 

   "The System" means the work of authorship, or the collection of works, that is made available under this License. 

   "The Source" means the source code of the work, including any modifications that you make to it. 

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that the users may redistribute the program under these terms, and telling them how to view a copy of this License. 

3. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

4. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Program.

5. THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE PROGRAM.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to use that Program under these terms. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If you modify this Program, you may choose to distribute the modified version under the terms of this License, or under the terms of a different license. However, if you choose to distribute the modified version under a different license, you must include a copy of this License with the modified version.

8. This License shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of law principles.

9. If you have any questions about this License, please contact the Free Software Foundation at licensing@fsf.org.
